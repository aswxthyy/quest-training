In object-oriented programming (OOP) in C#, inheritance is a
fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit methods, 
properties, and fields from another class. 
It promotes code reusability and helps to create hierarchical 
relationships between classes. Here are the main types of inheritance in C#:

1. Single Inheritance
Description: In this type, a class inherits from only one base class.
C# supports single inheritance, which allows a derived class to extend only one base class at a time.

2. Multiple Inheritance
Description: This type allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.
However, C# does not support multiple inheritance directly
(i.e., a class cannot inherit from more than one class). Instead, it can be achieved using interfaces.

3. Multilevel Inheritance
Description: In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit from a derived class,
thus creating a chain of inheritance.
The bottom-most class will have access to the members of both its direct parent class and the base class.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance
Description: In this type of inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
Each derived class can have its own additional properties and methods while still 
sharing the base class’s properties.

5. Hybrid Inheritance
Description: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
Since C# doesn’t support multiple inheritance directly through classes, 
hybrid inheritance can be implemented using a combination of interfaces and class inheritance.
